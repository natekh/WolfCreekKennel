            <h3>Meet the family</h3>

            <p>Our love for bulldogs started at an early age. At the age of 16, Kyle saved up the money to gift
                Jenny her first English bulldog. The rest is history! We were hooked to this breed and their
                loving, yet playful demeanor. Several years, and three kids later we are still dedicated to sharing
                our love of this breed with others!</p>
